My artist friend was looking for a simple tool that could mirror reference images for him (as opposed to opening photoshop). Figured CSS through the browser was the most lightweight. Quick 1 hour scrap code._

### _How to Use_

- Open the index.html file in your browser (any modern browser should work).
- Drag images from your computer into the white space.
- Dragging a new image in will replace the current one.
